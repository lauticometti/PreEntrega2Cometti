# space-tourism
I coded this web to get the certificate of a Coderhouse' course about web developer.

The original design is from frontendmentor.com, an amazing site with a lot of challenges to get experience with web technologies:
  They provide to you of a idea and you should get a solution. At the case of Space Tourism (and for all pay accounts) you get a Figma design.

For this project, I use three main techs:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- SCSS

I wanna highlight my skills with CSS3, they helped me a lot with the "funcionality" of the pages, because frontendmentor mention that Javascript is needs by the challenge, and there I've used just CSS3.
